## Protection and Backup of Scripts

### Critical Script Locations:
- **System scripts:** `/usr/local/bin/` (protected, requires root to modify)
- **User scripts:** `~/system-config-log/` (protected by home snapshots)
- **Documentation:** `~/commands/` (protected by home snapshots)

### Backup Strategy:
- All user scripts are protected by home directory snapshots
- System scripts are protected by root filesystem snapshots
- Documentation is automatically backed up in timeline snapshots
- Monthly archives provide long-term script preservation

### Recovery of Scripts:
If scripts are accidentally deleted, they can be recovered from:
1. **Home snapshots:** `snapper -c home list` ‚Üí restore from appropriate snapshot
2. **Root snapshots:** `sudo snapper -c root list` ‚Üí restore system scripts
3. **Monthly archives:** Long-term recovery option

---

## Script Maintenance Guidelines

### DO NOT DELETE:
- Any script in `/usr/local/bin/`
- Any script in `~/system-config-log/`
- Any documentation in `~/commands/`

### SAFE TO MODIFY:
- Script parameters and thresholds (after understanding impact)
- Log locations and retention
- Notification preferences

### MODIFICATION BEST PRACTICES:
1. Create snapshot before modifying: `snapper -c home create --description "pre-script-modification"`
2. Test modifications thoroughly
3. Keep backup copies of original scripts
4. Document any changes made

---

## Troubleshooting Script Issues

### Common Problems:
1. **Permission errors:** Check file permissions and ownership
2. **Missing dependencies:** Verify required tools are installed
3. **Path issues:** Ensure all paths in scripts are correct
4. **Service failures:** Check systemd service status

### Diagnostic Commands:
```bash
# Check script permissions
ls -la ~/system-config-log/*.sh

# Test script syntax
bash -n ~/system-config-log/script-name.sh

# Check systemd service status
systemctl status monthly-home-archive.service

# Review logs
journalctl -u monthly-home-archive.service -n 20
```

## Script Performance Impact

### Resource Usage:
- **Monitoring scripts:** Minimal CPU/memory impact
- **Optimization scripts:** Temporary increased I/O during execution
- **Archive scripts:** Brief CPU/disk usage during snapshot creation

### Execution Times:
- **snapshot-monitor.sh:** 30-60 seconds
- **weekly-optimization.sh:** 5-15 minutes
- **monthly-home-archive.sh:** 10-30 seconds
- **system-integration-test.sh:** 2-5 minutes
