## Phase 1: Home Directory Protection

### Configuration Changes
- **Added:** New snapper configuration for `/home` directory
- **File Created:** `/etc/snapper/configs/home`
- **Settings Applied:**
  - `TIMELINE_CREATE="no"` (initially manual-only)
  - `EXCLUDE_PATTERNS=".cache:.local/share/Trash:Downloads:.local/share/Steam"`
  - `SPACE_LIMIT="0.3"` and `FREE_LIMIT="0.1"`
  - `ALLOW_USERS="carnateo"` (user snapshot access)
  - `NUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT="999"` (unlimited important snapshots)

### Directory Structure Changes
- **Created:** `/home/.snapshots/` (snapshot storage directory)
- **Permissions:** 750 root:root with user access for carnateo

### New Capabilities
- Manual snapshot creation for home directory
- Individual file restoration from snapshots
- Surgical recovery without full rollbacks
- User-level snapshot management

---

## Phase 2: Timeline Automation

### Configuration Modifications
- **Modified:** `/etc/snapper/configs/home`
  - Changed `TIMELINE_CREATE="yes"` (enabled automation)
  - Set `TIMELINE_LIMIT_DAILY="3"`
  - Set `TIMELINE_LIMIT_WEEKLY="4"`
  - Set `TIMELINE_LIMIT_MONTHLY="0"` (handled separately)

### Systemd Services Configuration
- **Enabled:** `snapper-timeline.timer` (automatic snapshot creation)
- **Enabled:** `snapper-cleanup.timer` (automatic cleanup)
- **Schedule:** Hourly snapshots, daily cleanup at 14:01

### Monthly Archive System
- **Script Created:** `/usr/local/bin/monthly-home-archive.sh`
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Prevents duplicate monthly archives
  - Marks snapshots as "important" (never auto-deleted)
  - Logs to `~/system-config-log/monthly-archive.log`

- **Service Created:** `/etc/systemd/system/monthly-home-archive.service`
- **Timer Created:** `/etc/systemd/system/monthly-home-archive.timer`
  - Schedule: 1st of each month at 02:00 (+randomization)
  - Persistent across reboots

### New Automation Features
- Automatic hourly home directory snapshots
- Intelligent retention policy (3 daily, 4 weekly)
- Monthly permanent archives
- Automated cleanup of old snapshots

---

## Phase 3: System Cleanup - Nix Removal

### Decision Made - Traditional Package Management
- **Removed:** Nix Package Manager (too complex for daily use)
- **Reason:** Apps had problems finding configs due to non-standard paths
- **Alternative:** Use Docker, Python virtual environments, and AppImages for isolation when needed

### Filesystem Changes
- **Deleted:** `/nix/` directory and all contents
- **Removed:** `@nix` Btrfs subvolume
- **Modified:** `/etc/fstab` - Removed Nix mount entry
- **Cleaned:** Snapshots directory `/nix/.snapshots/` (removed)

### Configuration Cleanup
- **Modified:** `~/.bashrc` - Removed Nix environment variables
- **Removed:** `/etc/snapper/configs/nix` configuration
- **Cleaned:** All Nix-related profile directories

### New Approach
- **Primary:** Use AUR/pacman for system applications (simpler management)
- **Development:** Python virtual environments, Docker containers when needed
- **Isolation:** AppImages or Flatpaks for portable applications
- **Advantage:** All apps install to standard locations, better desktop integration
